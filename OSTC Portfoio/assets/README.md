Place your exported resume image or PDF in this folder using one of the filenames below:

- resume.png    (recommended — used as thumbnail and link)
- resume.jpg
- resume.pdf    (if you prefer a PDF, update contact.html link to resume.pdf)

After adding the file, open `contact.html` to preview. If you uploaded a PDF and want it displayed as an image, export a PNG/JPG preview from Canva and name it `resume.png`.
